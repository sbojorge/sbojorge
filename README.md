### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sara, a fresh ðŸ˜Ž Junior Full stack software developer.<br>
I (re)discovered coding in 2022 and got the impression that I had have found my new world so I didn't hesitate for a career change.<br>
So here I am with new tech skills and open to keep learning and sharing what I know.
